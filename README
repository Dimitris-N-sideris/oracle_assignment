# Oracle GBU Cloud Services Offline Test

## Requirements
python,pip
download libraries (numpy,pandas)
at the root of the project run

$pip install -r requirements.txt
OR
$pip install numpy pandas

### non standard libraries used: numpy, pandas
### root/source/ contains source code
### root/testing_files contains testing files
###  if the entry file in the repo is out of date, Download 'NASA_access_log_Aug95.gz with ftp by running: 
$ python ftp_download.py

# HOW TO RUN 
1.  Runs all tasks
$ python main.py > output_log_file.txt
2. Option pasing -m / --mode 
$ python main.py [-m, --mode] MODE  > output_log_file.txt
3. run unitests 
$ python test_main.py 
### Where MODE is one of [top10, successPercent, failedPercent, top10failed, top10hosts]
    top10:  Top 10 requested pages and the number of requests made for each
    successPercent: Percentage of successful requests (anything in the 200s and 300s range)
    failedPercent:  Percentage of unsuccessful requests (anything that is not in the 200s or 300s range)
    top10failed: Top 10 unsuccessful page requests
    top10hosts: The top 10 hosts making the most requests, displaying the IP address and number of requests made


### Assumptions
- for task #6 if [-m, --mode] MODE is given but MODE is not one of the valid options it defaults to run all tasks
task 7 always runs and is not part of MODE option
- file should be locally named 'NASA_access_log_Aug95.gz', you can download through ftp with a commented line in oracle_assignment.py if needed
- log file created through piping output to file through linux pipes eg 'python main.py > log_filename.txt'

The pandas read_csv() ignores the bad entries and displays error
8. The log file contains malformed entries; for each malformed line, display an error
message and the line number.
