Coding challenge
## Use a programming language of your choice, and keeping non-standard library dependencies
to a minimum (less than 5), parse the sample HTTP sample log file available at NASA-FTP, to
produce a plain text report containing the following information:
(ftp://ita.ee.lbl.gov/traces/ )
1. Top 10 requested pages and the number of requests made for each
2. Percentage of successful requests (anything in the 200s and 300s range)
3. Percentage of unsuccessful requests (anything that is not in the 200s or 300s range)
4. Top 10 unsuccessful page requests
5. The top 10 hosts making the most requests, displaying the IP address and number of
requests made.
6. Option parsing to produce only the report for one of the previous points (e.g. only the
top 10 URLs, only the percentage of successful requests and so on)
7. For each of the top 10 hosts, show the top 5 pages requested and the number of
requests for each page
8. The log file contains malformed entries; for each malformed line, display an error
message and the line number.
The deliverable must be a repository under version control and contain the following:
• All source files
• Documentation explaining how to use the tool, what its dependencies are and any
assumptions you made while writing it
• Unit tests
